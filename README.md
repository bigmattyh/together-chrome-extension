# Together Chrome Extension

This is an extension for Google Chrome that provides a simple interface for saving pages to [Together.app][1]. Pages can be saved to **PDF**, as **bookmarks**, or as **web archives**.

## How does it work? 

The extension puts a little icon near your address bar:

![Living next to your address bar, awaiting your click…](docs/closed.png)

Clicking on the icon brings up a compact menu that lets you choose how to save the web page.

![And clicked.](docs/open.png)

When one of these buttons is clicked, the extension gets the title and address of your active tab and sends them to Together. The native app does the rest.

## How do I install it?

1. [Download the extension](packed/Together.crx?raw=true).
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
3. Drag the extension into Chrome.

Pretty easy.

## Is this official?

No. But I really like the Together app, and the only way to save web pages, currently, is to drag bookmarklets to your browser. I'm not a fan of bookmarklets, though. So I spent a little time to make this. Now I've got a handy little icon in a nice, compact package.

## Does this extension do anything creepy or weird with my information?

**No.** The source code (which lives in [/src](/src)) is short and straightforward — you can verify for yourself!

## What is *Together*?

It's a really great notebook/documents-management app by a guy named Steve Harris. Or perhaps I should say "a guy *called* Steve Harris," because he's from the UK, and that's how they say it there.

I recently spent about a week trying out a bunch of apps for note- and document management, and Together was my clear favorite. It has a great Yosemite-style UI and has the ability to sort your notes and documents by tags or in a folder hierarchy. Evernote is well-designed and has earned its ubiquity, but it has a limited feature set that restrains the way I like to organize things. Apps like Yep and Leap and Notebooks have a lot more features, but Together has the best combination of everything. I recommend [checking it out][1].

## Can you make one of these for Safari? Or Firefox?

Sure? Drop me a note here, and I'll answer the demand, if there is one.
